## Install the Command-line Tool and the Plugins

You will also need the Fonoster command-line and the "phone" plugin. To install the tools, run the following commands:

```

Then, 

```bash

Finally, you will need a Fonoster account from https://console.fonoster.io/.

You are all set, but if you want to start experimenting with API, you can head to the [learning page](https://learn.fonoster.com/) at Fonoster.
